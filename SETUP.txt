Setting Up TCSE Eyes...

[System Requirements]
- System with database that laravel is compatible. See .env-template file for list of supported database systems.

[Setup Steps]
- Copy-Paste the project on a desired location on the system.
- Look for .env-template and rename it to .env
- Open the renamed .env file and put the necessary configuration specially the database information such as username/password.
- Once done, run the database migration of laravel.
---> Open terminal/cmd and navigate to the location of tcseeyes project.
---> Run the migration command: # php artisan migrate
- Once database is created, paste the crawler files on /resources/views/crawler. Also ensure you update the database credentials of those files.
- Run the site using the internal artisan tool of laravel.

*****localhost access only*****
---> # php artisan serve
*****external access*****
---> # php artisan serve --host [Desired IP] --port [Desired Port]


[Other Notes]
- Files under /resources/views/crawler/ are responsible for getting data from TCSEEyes API. These are coded natively and will be provided separately as database passwords are hardcoded.
- Once got, place these files on /resources/views/crawler/


[First Time Use]
- For first time use, database contents need to be populated from the /all url access of TCSEEyes API. To do it, follow the steps below.
---> Get the crawler files from me.
---> Place the files on /resources/views/crawler/
---> For each of the file open it and edit it. Put the necessary database username and password. 
---> Change the data source to the /all url address of TCSEEyes API. Location is at line 20 of each file.
---> once done, serve again/rerun the website through artisan.
---> crawlers are tied on the nav bar of the site. So navigate on each available options on navbar to trigger the crawler.
- Once done with triggering all the crawlers scripts, change the API access url of TCSEEyes to daily/today so that it doesn't have to crawl all database from API during use.
